# UDACITY SDCND: Model Predictive Control
---
The objective of this project was to use Model Predictive Control Method to drive the car in autonomous mode inside the simulator. The code has been implemented in C++. The model has provided the latency to the car actuator to make it similar to real world behaviour.
